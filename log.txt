speaker 0 : Apartment . Don't cry . You know your 
speaker 1 : life . Okay , honey , but issue award 
speaker 2 : narrowest target demographic . What's up ? I'm going to be here and this is a 
speaker 4 : brand new smartphone from Sony . 
speaker 4 : Called the Sony Xperia pro . So what do you guys may remember , I pretty recently did a video on why people don't buy Sony phones where you know , I gave their recent phones a lot of credit and admired how technically impressive they were . 
speaker 4 : But eventually landed basically on the conclusion that 
speaker 3 : people 
speaker 4 : don't buy these because they're focused on enthusiast Cher's at dispense of the everyday normal experience . 
speaker 4 : There's just not a recipe for selling a lot of them . So then they dropped this new phone and this phone 
speaker 4 : This phone takes that imbalance farther than any phone I've ever seen , for all the good and all the bad . So just looking at this guy , You know , the phone itself is pretty understated . It doesn't seem that special right off the top . 
speaker 4 : It's basically an xperia one mark two again , which was great fun , but it's a year old now . So it's the same snapdragon 8 65 same internal specs . Same four K display . 
speaker 4 : Same triple camera system on the back . But as you can kind of start to see its modified in a few key ways and it costs $2500.25 . Okay , okay . 
speaker 4 : Hold on a second . It's called the pro and , you know , we know that the pro phones are the highest end ones the best of the best . So what's so special about this one ? Right hot . Take this phone is the only real 
speaker 4 : Pro phone . It's the only phone that deserves the word pro in the name . Okay , so we have iPhone 12 pro cool while away mate , 40 pro Nice plus April , But those phones are just using the word pro . 
speaker 4 : To sell you , you know , upscale everyday phones . This phone is an actual professional tool . So it starts with the design Right at the bottom of the stone . You'll find a literal HDMI port . So that's a micro HD my plug behind this flap alongside the USB type C So you don't see that very often . So keep this in mind and then instead of straight glass and metal , this phone is coated in this black 
speaker 4 : Polycarbonate jacket all the way around on the sides on the back , even on the front , and it's pretty nice . Actually , there's no camera bump , so the phone sits perfectly flat and honestly , you probably don't even really need a case for this song . It's kind of ruggedized that way . 
speaker 4 : You do lose wireless charging for some reason , but as you'll see pretty soon , that's not a huge concern . 
speaker 4 : Then last , but not least , this phone has an array of five g and tennis . You have four beam forming antennas all the way around this phone that no doubt take advantage of the plastic jacket .
